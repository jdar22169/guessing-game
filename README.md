This is my guessing game assignment. 
I created a guessing game using if..else statements.
The user has to guess 'yes' or 'no' to 5 questions. 
All the questions revolve around me, and my likes and dislikes. 

I'm not really good at jokes, so I googled one:

What do you get when you cross a dyslexic, an insomniac and an agnostic?

Someone who lies awake and wonders if there is a dog.

I found it on www.thefederalistpapers.org
